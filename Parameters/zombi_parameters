### PARAMETERS SPECIES TREE LEVEL ###
## Please refer to the manual for more details
#
SPECIATION	f:1
#
EXTINCTION	f:0.5
#
## STOPPING_RULE = 0 to control depending on TIME, = 1 to control depending on TOTAL_LINEAGES
STOPPING_RULE	1
#
## TOTAL_TIME says when to stop if STOPPING_RULE = 0
#
TOTAL_TIME	1
#
## TOTAL_LINEAGES says when to stop if STOPPING_RULE = 1
#
TOTAL_LINEAGES	20
#
## The simulation fails (and tries again) if the number of lineages in the EST goes below MIN_LINEAGES (when using the stopping rule = 0)
#
MIN_LINEAGES	1
#
## The simulation fails (and tries again) if the number of lineages exceeds MAX_LINEAGES
#
MAX_LINEAGES	10000
#
## VERBOSE = 0 not to print progess, = 1 to do it
#
VERBOSE 1
